**ML Unsupervised Learning: Book Recommendation System**

Welcome to the ML Unsupervised Learning Book Recommendation System repository! This project aims to build a recommendation system for books using unsupervised machine learning techniques.

**Introduction**

In this repository, you'll find code and resources to implement a book recommendation system using unsupervised learning algorithms. The recommendation system suggests books to users based on their preferences and behavior, without the need for explicit ratings or labels.

**Features**

Unsupervised Learning Techniques: Utilizes clustering algorithms such as k-means or hierarchical clustering to group similar books and users.

Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling.

Scalability: Designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently, ensuring scalability as the user and book database grows.
